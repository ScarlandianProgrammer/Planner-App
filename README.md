# Planner App (Name TBD)

This app is a project that I started to keep practicing my development skills.

The functionality that I currently want to get for this app:
- create multiple lists of to-do items
- have a functioning calendar that can let you set due dates for items
- send notifications to the user's machine at a customizable time
